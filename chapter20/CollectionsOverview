The Java Collections Framework standardizes the way in which group of object are handled
by your program.

Collection Framework Goals: 
1. meet high performance 
2. allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner 
3. extending had to be easy

The entired framework is built upon a set of standard interfaces. 

Several standard implementations, such as LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet of theses interfaces 
are provided that you may use as-is. 

Algorithms are another important part of the collection mechanism. 
Algorithms operate on collections and are defined as static methods within the Collection class. 
The algorithms provide a standard means of manipulating collections. 

Iterator interface is closly related to the collections framework. 
It provides a means of enumerating the contents of a collection. 

Although maps are part of the Collections Framework, they are not "collections" in the strict use of the term. 
You can, however, obtain a collection-view of a map. 
Such a view contains the elements from the map stored in a collection. 
Thus, you can process the contents of a map as a collection, if you choose to.
