Now you are ready to examine the standard classes that implement the collection interfaces. 

The ArrayList Class 
extends AbstractList and implements the List interface. 
toString() is inherited from AbstractCollection 
toArray() is defined by Collection 

The LinkedList Class 
extends AbstractSequentialList and implements the List, Deque, and Queue interfaces. 

The HashSet Class 
extends AbstractSet and implements the Set Interface. 
it creates a collection that ses a hash table for storage. 

The LinkedHashSet Class 
extends HashSet and adds only one method newLinkedHashSet()
maintains a linked list of the entries in the set 
in the order in which they were inserted 

The TreeSet Class
extends AbstractSet and implements the NavigableSet interface. 
It creates a collection that uses a tree for storage. 
Objects are stored in sorted, ascending order. 

The PriorityQueue class 
extends AbstractQueue and implements the Queue interface 

The ArrayDeque Class 
extends AbstractCollection and implements the Deque interface 
It adds no methods of its own. 
ArrayDeque creates a dynamic array and has no capacity restrictions. 

The EnumSet Class 

extends AbstractSet and implements Set. 
It is for use with "enum" type.
