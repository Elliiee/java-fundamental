In addition to the collection interfaces, collections also use Comparator, RandomAccess, Iterator, ListIterator, and Spliterator interfaces. 

The Collection interface is the foundation upon which the Collections Framework is built because it must be implemented by any class that defines a collection. 
interface Collection<E>

Collection extends the Iterable interface. Collection -> Iterable 
This means that all collections can be cycled through by use of the for each style for loop. 

The SequencedCollection Interface 

The List interface extends SequencedCollection 

The Set interface defines a set. 
It extends Collection and specifies the behavior of a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. 

The SequencedSet Interface 
introduced in JDK 21, extends both Set and SequencedCollection

The SortedSet Interface 
extends SequencedSet and order it's elements in ascending order. 

The Navigatable Interface 
extends SortedSet 
supports the retrieval of elements based on the closest match to a given value or values. 

The Queue Interface 
extends Collection

The Deque Interface
extends Queue and SequencedCollection
is a double-ended queue.
