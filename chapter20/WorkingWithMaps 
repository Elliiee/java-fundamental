Note that maps don't implement the Iterable interface. So you can't use for loop directly. 
In order to use for loop, we need to obtain a collection-view of the map. 

the map interfaces 
1. Map
2. Map.Entry (nested interface)
3. NavigableMap
4. SequencedMap
5. SortedMap

Note that Maps are not collections, because they don't implement Collection interface. 
However, you can obtain a collection-view of a map by using the entrySet() method. 
entrySet() method returns a Set that contains the elements in the map. 
also, keySet() returns the collection-view of the keys. 
values() returns the collection-view of the values. 
For all three collection-views, the collection is backed by the map. Changing one affects the other!

The SequencedMap Interface
extends Map to define a special kind of map whose entries have a well-defined encounter order. 

The SortedMap interface
extends SequencedMap
entries are maintained in ascending order 

The Navigable interface 
extends SortedMap

The Map.Entry interface

The Map Classes 
1. AbstractMap 
2. EnumMap
3. HashMap 
4. TreeMap 
5. WeakHashMap
6. LinkedHashMap 
7. IdentityHashMap 

The HashMap Class 
extends AbstractMap and implements the Map interface. 

The TreeMap class 
extends AbstractMap and implements the NavigableMap interface 
maps stored in a tree structure.
