you can specify a regular expression that represents a general form that 
can match several different specific character sequences. 

There are two classes that support regular expression: 
Pattern 
Matcher 

use Pattern to defiene a regular expression
then match the Pattern against another sequence using Matcher 

In the language of regular expression, s normal character is also called a "literal". 

A character class is a set of characters. 
in brackets: []
for example, [xyz]: matches x, or y, or z 
NOT [^xyz]: matches any character except x, y and z 

use a hyphen to specify the range [1-9]

The wildcard character is the . (dot), it matches any character. 

A quantifier determines how many times an expression is matched. 
+ : match 1 or more 
* : match 0 or more 
? : match 0 or 1 (match or doesn't match)

In general, if you specify an invalid expression, a PatternSyntaxException will be thrown.
