A pattern is created by calling the compile() factor method. 
The input parameter is the regular expression you want to use. 
It returns a Pattern object that contains the pattern. 

Once you have created a Pattern object, you will use it to create a Matcher. 
This is done by calling the matcher() method defined by Pattern. 
The input parameter CharSequence is an interface that defines a read-only set of characters. 
You can pass a string to matcher(), inside which, you want to find if there are any matches.
