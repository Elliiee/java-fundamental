Like Pattern class, Matcher class does not have constructors either. 
You create a Matcher by calling the matcher() factory method defined by Pattern. 

matches() methods determines whether the character sequence matches the pattern. 
It returns true if the sequence and the pattern match, false otherwise. Notice that the entire 
sequence must match the pattern, not just a subsequence of it. (completely match every character)

otherwise use find() method to determine if only a subsequence matches the pattern. 
This method can be called repeatedly, allowing it to find all matching subsequences. 
Each call to find() begins where the previous one left off. 

You can obtain a string containing the last matching sequence by calling group() method.
