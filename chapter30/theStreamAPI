A stream is a conduit for data. 

A stream represents a sequence of objects. 
operates on a data source, such as an array or a collection
itself, never stores the data!
it only moves data 
it does not change the original data source, it operates and creates a new steam result 
this stream is different from the I/O stream, this means objects

The stream API defines several stream interfaces 
package java.util.stream
module java.base 

BaseStream, the foundation interface 

BaseStream extends AutoClosable interface, so we can use try-with-resources statement. 
But for those data from the collections, no need to close anything. 
close a file is more reasonable 

interface Stream implements BaseStream
